There are 3 different versions of AES encryption, each has a block size of 128 bits, but with different key lengths: 128, 192 and 256 bits.

AES has been adopted by the U.S. government.

AES is included in the ISO/IEC 18033-3 standard. AES became effective as a U.S. federal government standard on May 26, 2002, after approval by U.S. Secretary of Commerce Donald Evans. AES is available in many different encryption packages, and is the first (and only) publicly accessible cipher approved by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) for top secret information when used in an NSA approved cryptographic module

Who uses AES encryption?

Wi-Fi networks, Google Cloud, Facebook Messenger, Java programming, and many password managers use AES encryption to protect their data. 
As of 2021, AES is the worldâ€™s most popular data protection method.
